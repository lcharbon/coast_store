Clearly they went next level on the materials.\n\nThe fit is perfect. People have been asking where I got this bathing suit!! It just looks great. It's a modern sexy alternative to boring swimwear.\n\nOh and shipping was blazing fast.\n\n\nOut with the board shorts! Time for some style.\n\n\nI highly recommend to anyone. I mean everyone has a bathing suit right?\n\nGive it a try! (Prices are way under the competition)",
